# 1. Basics of Git
## 1.1. Centralized version control
- Limitations:
  - If the main server goes down, developers canâ€™t save versioned changes
  - Remote commits are slow
  - Unsolicited changes might ruin development
  - If the central database is corrupted, the entire history could be lost (security issues)

## 1.2. Decentralized version control
- Local repos host all versions
  - `pull`: get the updates from central server
  - `push`: send the updated repos to the central server
- Advantage:
  - Full history is always available
  - No need to access a remote server (faster access)
  - Abibility to push your changes continously

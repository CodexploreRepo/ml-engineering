# Container
## What are Containers
- Container: A way to package the ML program and running the package as a set of **resource-isolated** processes.
- Containers take a different approach compared to VM: by leveraging the low-level mechanics of the host operating system, containers provide most of the isolation of virtual machines at a fraction of the computing power.

## Why Containers 
- This decoupling allows container-based applications to be deployed easily and consistently, regardless of whether the target environment is a
  - private data center,
  - the public cloud,
  - or even a developerâ€™s personal laptop.
- Containers (& Docker) have seen widespread adoption. Companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix and Salesforce leverage containers to make large engineering teams more productive

## Operating System
- Kernel (required): Basic Part to start a host machine
  - Kernel modules (nfs, ip_tables)
  - Device drivers
  - System tools (shell, compiler)
  - Libraries (socket, ssl, crypto)
  - Utilities (file manager)

- Other dependencies (optional)

## Old Fashion of Deployment
- Multiple apps per host
- Shared dependencies

## New Way: Deploy Containers
- Only share the kernel

## From Physical Machine to Container
- Only dependency is system kernel when building the container

# Docker
- Docker is a Linux-based, open-source containerization **platform** that developers use to build, run, and package applications for deployment using containers
  -  provide utilies to build & run the containers

## Docker 101
- `Image` a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. (like a recipe)
- `Container` A container is a runnable instance of an image (a cake made by the recipe)
  - You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. 
  - You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.
- `Docker Daemon`: The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers. The daemon is the process that runs in the operating system which clients talk to.
  - build the container image from the docker file. 
- `Docker Client` - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the daemon. More generally, there can be other forms of clients too - such
as Kitematic which provide a GUI to the users.
- `Docker Registries` (repositories) - A registry of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images. If required, one can host their own Docker registries and can use them for pulling images.
  - Google Cloud, Azure provides their own repositories (container registries)
